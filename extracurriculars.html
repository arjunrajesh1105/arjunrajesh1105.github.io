           <p id = "Intern">
             I was selected as youngest Discovery Corps member are through an application and group interview process. 
               
             During camp, I assisted a supervisor during camp week. I was assigned a room where I was in charge of supervising the 2nd grade kids and their activities. 
             I took the kids through the exhibit halls. Also, another one of my tasks was to be in charge of several children, making sure they were safe and keeping them entertained and interested in the exhibits.

          
             Additionally, our team of volunteers had a project. We had to come up with a product we could present to the board to be used in demonstrations for kids in the Space Hall, and if they like it they can choose to buy that item.
             We had to take into consideration the cost of the product, where it could be bought, where it could be used (had to be charged, etc.) Our product was a plasma ball, and it was chosen!

            Perot Museum Lead Volunteer
            
            <p id = "Volunteer"> 
                I was selected from amongst the graduates of the Discovery Corps program, based on a recommendation from Discovery Corps program supervisor.
        There is a 24 hour for every 3 month period requirement and I chose a hall for each shift. During my shifts, I make sure everything’s running smoothly and often run the interactive machines (if any are present in the chosen hall for my shift) and ensuring everyone’s safety, etc.
        Also, I attended meetings with Volunteer Management Team, 2 interns, and 2 General Volunteers and participated in sharing feedback about how to improve exhibits based on observation of how museum visitors were interacting with the exhibits. (For example, suggesting how to improve the interactive features). 
        I obtained 2 Presidential Awards (Gold level), for 100 hours of service for students 16 and under, and I currently am a Lead Volunteer at Perot with nearly 300 hours of service. Some duties as a lead volunteer are to compile photo documentation of the program to be used in the newsletter and an end-of-program slideshow. 
        Additionally, I monitored volunteers and provide assistance by covering their station when they go on break and making sure everything runs smoothly. Also, I provide support to new student volunteers as they brainstorm their ideas for their professional interview project, and I often resolve technical issues for their presentation.

                Sierra Club - Committee Member
                This was an amazing opportunity as I was able to work with Chrysta Castañeda for Railroad Commissioner of Texas Election Campaign. To assist with her campaign, I attended zoom meetings to learn about the campaign’s vision for building a more environmentally friendly future and to receive task assignments, such as contacting over 100 constituents with campaign information via text message.
               Additionally, I worked on political campaigns for candidates Joanna Cattanach and Brandy Chambers, and I assisted Matt Johnson, Political Director of the State Chapter, with arranging campaigns such as letter writing and literature drops.
               
                Sierra Club - Student Committee
                After getting to work with political officials and helping out with Sierra Club, a group of friends and I decided to make a student committee at our high schol to make a larger impact on our enviornment. I held an officer position as a secretary, and some tasks that I was given were to manage detailed records on meeting attendance, volunteer hours, and task allocation in preparation for upcoming projects.
                I also collaborated with the Ecology club to build a composting bin on campus and implemented a shift system to maintain it. Addiitonally, we campaigned to attempt to install solar panels at Coppell High School and to reduce food waste in the cafeteria. We also helped organize and was involved in environmental cleanup projects and collaborated with officials and assisted them with their campaign.

            Coppell High School Debate
            
            <p id = "Debate">
                In 9th grade, I joined the Coppell HS Debate team and I focused on Policy Debate. During that year I competed in 4 tournaments and won 10+ rounds and attended weekly practices in order to improve my skills. In 10th grade, I became a Coppell HS Varsity Debate Team Member, and I competed in 5 tournaments that year and won 12+ rounds. Additionally, I helped the novice team by coaching them in practice weekly once. 
                Furthermore, I practiced on my own time about three times a week for 30 minutes, using assignments and drills. After 10th grade, I became a member of the National Speech & Debate Association Honors Society and won a Merit Degree (for competing in tournaments and achieving 33 points) and an Honor Degree (for competing in tournaments and achieving 75 point from winning rounds)
                In 11th grade, I mentored two younger students at the novice level who had recently joined the debate team. I worked with them once a week, let them practice, provided them feedback, and helped them prepare for upcoming tournaments. On top of that, I wanted to get some experience judging, so I decided to judge in a few annual local novice tournaments.
