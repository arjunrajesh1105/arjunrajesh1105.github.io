               I started as a volunteer in 8th grade for the National Junior Honors Society and then I was invited to participate in training during 8th grade summer. I began working in 9th grade and had tasks such as: <br>
→ Graded homework and tests, mainly Math, but also helped out with Reading. Mainly elementary, some middle, and a few high school students. <br> 
→ Walk around the room and offer support to several students at one time. <br>
→ Occasionally help students one-on-one with their work, though. <br>
→ STAAR testing, helped prepare for the math section using practice materials. <br>
→ One kid, Adam, was stuck on one level for a long time, but after I started helping him (I would spend 30 minutes with him every time he visited), and after a month he was able to move on to the next level. <br>
  <br>              
 Eventually, I became trusted with more responsibilities during 10th grade. <br> 
→ I sometimes had to manage the front desk to field questions from parents.  <br>
→ I also made schedules for trash duty and other tasks. <br> 
→ I had to pulled out homework for students (to send home with them). <br>
→ Also started doing Data Entry in 10th grade -- something only a select number of people are allowed to do -- which includes entering data on every student’s homework into their file. <br> 
→ Train new employees <br>
